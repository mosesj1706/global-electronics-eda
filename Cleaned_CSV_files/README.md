# Cleaned_CSV_files/

This folder contains **cleaned datasets** generated from the raw data in `Uncleaned_CSV_files/`.

## Notes
- Files are created by running `notebooks/Data_Cleaning.ipynb`.
- Cleaned files include:
  - `Customers_clean.csv`
  - `Products_clean.csv`
  - `Sales_clean.csv`
  - `Stores_clean.csv`
  - `Exchange_Rates_clean.csv`

⚠️ Large datasets should not be pushed to GitHub. Instead, only **sample cleaned files** or small subsets should be committed for reference.
